  <h2 id="h2-what-is-skate">What is Skate?</h2>
  <p>Skate is a library designed to be an easy-to-use, minimal and performant foundation for building modular and reusable web components. It's built on the philosophy that all libraries should be focused on doing one thing well and therefore makes no assumptions about things better left to other libraries such as templating, data-binding and routing. It can be used standalone or along-side your framework of choice.</p>



  <h3>Custom Elements</h3>

  <p>Skate uses the <a href="http://w3c.github.io/webcomponents/spec/custom/">W3C Custom Element Spec</a> as the basis for defining its functionality and extends it to make it easier for you to build new custom elements as well as transition your legacy components to custom elements.</p>
  <p>Custom elements are just normal HTML elements that you give a custom name and functionality to:</p>
